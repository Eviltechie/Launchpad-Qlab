When starting up, we get the list of workspaces and connect to the first one.
If we receive a disconnect on that workspace, we query the list of workspaces and pick the first one again.
If we receive an empty list of workspaces, we query again in 2 seconds.


When connecting to a workspace, we query for all cues.


When we receive all cues, query the position for all cues on the first cart wall.
Also count how many of those cues/queries we sent out.


As we receive cue positions, we store them in a map.
As we receive each position, compare the size of the map (num received) with the number of cues on the first wall. When these match we have all locations queried.


When we have all locations queried, then we can.... (Set colors on launchpad?)


If any update is received, and that update is not any group cue, then query for all cues.









If the lists are the same, then assume a cue is playing/paused/stopped, or it updated position.


If any update is received, re-load the entire cue state, and compare it to the last state.
If they are different, something on the workspace changed (new cue, deleted cue, ~~updated position~~, updated color).
That is our cue to reload the launchad and set the MIDI values.

If they are the same though, then what changed may be that the cue started/stopped playing.
In this case, do a shallow query of the currently running cues.


Edge case, currently running cue deleted?
